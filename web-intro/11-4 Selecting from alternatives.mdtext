Body:

As described earlier, in our discussion of [[4.2 CSS frameworks]], you can drop several different CSS files into a special collection subfolder named `css`, and then choose to apply any one of them using *Collection > Settings* (Cmd-;). 

Such a choice would override any of the other Notenik CSS options we've described so far.
