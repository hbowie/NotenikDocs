Title:  Create the blog home

Seq:    6.13

Level:  3 - section

Body:

Let's go back to our `pages` collection in Notenik.

Let's add a new note. 

Give it a Title of `Blog`. 

Then enter a Header of `Herb's Blog` (replacing my name with yours). 

Enter a Seq value of `2`. 

You can omit any value for the Body. 

Now save your new note. 

Now go back to the `About` note and change its Seq value to `3`, so that it will appear to the right of the Blog button in the Nav bar.
