Let's go back to our `pages` collection in Notenik.

Let's add a new note. 

Give it a Title of `Herb's Blog` (replacing my name with yours). 

Enter an AKA value of `Blog`. 

Enter a Seq value of `2`. 

Now save your new note. 

Now go back to the "About" note and change its Seq value to `3`, so that it will appear to the right of the Blog button in the Nav bar.
