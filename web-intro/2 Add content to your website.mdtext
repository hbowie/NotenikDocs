Title:  Add content to your website

Seq:    2

Level:  2 - chapter

Body:

Start by reading the corresponding [HTML for people chapter](https://www.htmlforpeople.com/add-content-to-your-website/).

Notenik allows you to preview your content right within the app, by viewing the *Display* tab, so we won't be running our build script, and regenerating our `index.html` file, until we are done adding all of the new content for this chapter.
