Title:  Create a second content page

Seq:    5.1

Level:  3 - section

Class:  text

Body:

We're going to create a second content page. 

And we're going to do this within Notenik. 

Start by selecting your home (aka *Index*) page, then right-click on the row in the *List* tab, then select *duplicate*.

This will create a copy of your first note, ready for modification. 

Go ahead and change the Title to `About`. 

Change the Header to `About _____` (with your name replacing the underscores). I'll enter `About Herb` for mine.  

Then enter `2` in the Seq field. 

Then go through and modify the Body in the ways suggested by Blake. 

Don't forget that you'll generally be using Markdown instead of HTML within the Body field. 

Here's a handy little [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) you can refer to as needed. 

Here's my text within the Body field.

My name is Herb. I enjoy making websites, and making 
software to make it easier to make websites. I was inspired 
by [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com) to write 
a companion guide showing any Mac user how they can 
start making their own websites using my app Notenik. 

I've made a number of websites, including 
[Reason to Rock](https://reasontorock.com), the [
Lexicon of Song](https://lexiconofsong.org) and the 
[Big Ideas in Software Development](https://www.softdevbigideas.com/).
