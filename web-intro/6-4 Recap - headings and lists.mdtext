Title:  Recap: headings and lists

Seq:    6.4

Level:  3 - section

Body:

You can create headings at any level by placing that number of `#` characters at the beginning of a line. 

For example, this would produce a level 3 heading. 

```
### Level 3 Heading
```

And here's our sample unordered list. 

```
+ Bread
+ Sugar
+ Hole
```

And here's what this would look like. 

+ Bread
+ Sugar
+ Hole

And here's an ordered list, first in code, and then rendered as HTML. 

```
1. **Portable Happiness:** Donuts are the perfect grab-and-go food. You can take them anywhere: to work, to the park, or on a road trip. They’re like little circles of happiness that fit in your hand.
2. **Instant Mood Boost:** Feeling down? Have a donut. It’s scientifically proven\* that donuts can turn a frown upside down. (\*Not actually proven, but we all know it’s true.)
3. **Endless Creativity:** Donut shops are constantly coming up with new and exciting flavors. From maple bacon to matcha green tea, the possibilities are endless. It’s like a delicious adventure every time you visit.

One thing to point out here is that we had to use a  backslash before each asterisk in the second item to prevent those asterisks from being interpreted as part of our Markdown syntax. This is called a [backslash escape](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#backslash).

Markdown also allows you to nest one list within another, simply by indenting the lower-level list with four leading spaces, or one leading tab character. 

Here's an example in code. 

```
+ First main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
+ Second main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
```

And here's how it will render. 

+ First main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
+ Second main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
