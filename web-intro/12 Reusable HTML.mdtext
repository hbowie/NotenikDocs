Body:

Blake's bonus chapter on [Reusable HTML with PHP](https://www.htmlforpeople.com/reusable-html-with-php/) describes an alternative to use of Notenik's merge templates, and I've already shown you how to use those to avoid duplicating HTML boilerplate. So no need to read this bonus chapter from Blake, unless you wish to explore alternatives to use of Notenik.
