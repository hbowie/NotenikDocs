Seq:    6

Level:  2 - chapter

Body:

Start by reading the corresponding [HTML for people chapter](https://www.htmlforpeople.com/adding-a-blog/).

But we're going to proceed here in a slightly different fashion. 

We'll start by creating some posts for our blog, then circle back to see how we create the blog home page and updated navigation.
