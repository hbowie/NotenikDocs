Body:

Beneath the Nav menu you will find commands (and keyboard shortcuts) that allow you to move through your collection either using the current list sort sequence, or using your own navigation history. 

In particular, it can be quite useful to memorize the keyboard shortcut that allows you to go back in history, so that you can retrace your steps back to a previous page you had been viewing.
