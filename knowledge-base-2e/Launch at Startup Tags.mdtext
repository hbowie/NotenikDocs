Level:  5 - details

Class:  non-version

Body:

A special 'Launch at Startup' tag can be added to a Note with a Link if you would like that Note's Link to be launched whenever Notenik starts up. 

This special startup logic will only be executed once per day per collection, and it will only be executed for a collection that is automatically opened when Notenik starts up -- such as an Essential Collection.
