Body:

Different fields can be formatted for display in different ways. For example, a date may be entered one way, but you may wish to consistently display all dates in some consistent format. 

Also, because fields allow each important element of a Note to be separately addressed, you can use fields to customize the formatting of a page, showing some fields, hiding others, and arranging them in whatever ways seems most useful to you.
