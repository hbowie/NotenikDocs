Title:  A Sample Collection to Work With

Seq:    1.2

Level:  3 - Topic

Body:

As you work your way through this Master Class, you may find it useful to have a sample Collection you can inspect and experiment with as you learn to apply new concepts and features. A good starting point can be generated by creating a **New Collection**, and then selecting **12 - Website** as your starting Collection type. You will then end up with a folder containing examples of much of what will be discussed in this class. See the `README.md` file, or the relevant [Knowledge Base page](notenik://help?id=website) for more info about this helpful starter pack.
