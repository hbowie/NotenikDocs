Title:  Collection Preferences

Seq:    6.2

Level:  3 - Topic

Body:

Both when creating a new collection, and at any time later, you may use the Collection Preferences window to modify the list of fields being used for that collection. 

This works by presenting all of the collection's currently defined fields, as well as other common fields, as lists of checkboxes. Check one of the unchecked boxes to add a new field; uncheck one of the checked boxes to discard one of the current fields.
