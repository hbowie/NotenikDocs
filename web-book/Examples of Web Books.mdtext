Title:  Examples of Web Books

Seq:    3

Level:  2

Body:

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:

+ *[Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)* by Matthew Butterick
+ *[Reason to Rock](https://www.reasontorock.com)*, by yours truly
+ *[Big Ideas in Software Development](https://www.softdevbigideas.com)*, also by me
+ *[The Notenik Knowledge Base](https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html)*
+ *[Important Things to Know About Humans](https://abouthumans.net)*, once again one of mine

Note that I'll primarily be referring to this last one as an example as I go through this Notenik aid. 

You can find all the supporting Notenik source files for this last site on GitHub, at [github.com/hbowie/about-humans](https://github.com/hbowie/about-humans).
