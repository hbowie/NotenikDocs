Body:

##### Fix for Web Book Export with Alternate Note IDs

Fixed the [[web book export]] to accurately recall [[collection metadata commands]] when the [[Note Identifiers]] have been changed to something other than the default [[Title]] field identifier.

##### Provide Add-Ins Support for Web Book Export

When performing an [[Export as Web Book]], and when choosing Web Book as Site, Notenik will now copy any [[Add-Ins for CSS and Javascript]] to the output web folder.

##### Upgraded Website Starter Packs

When creating a new Collection, Notenik offers both a general Website starter pack as well as an HTML for People demo starter pack. Both of these have been upgraded, and should now be fairly stable for the foreseeable future.
