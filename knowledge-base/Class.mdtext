Body:

The word `class` can be used as both a label and a type. 

A Collection is not expected to have more than one field of type `class`. 

The class field is meant to identify a particular type of Note within a Collection. 

You can specify a list of possible values for the class field within [[the Collection Template file]]. 

Here's an example of how you would do this: 

	Class: <class: biblio, cover, def, quote, text, title>
	
In other words, enter the usual field label, followed by a colon, and then follow that with the possible values, separated using commas or semicolons.

You can also specify a default value by placing an asterisk after your desired default, as in the following example:

	Class: <class: biblio, cover, def, quote, text*, title>

Note that the default will cause the field to be populated when creating a new Note, but will not cause any associated class template file to be immediately applied. 
	
As always, be sure to Reload the Collection after making changes to the Collection template!

Each class value may have an associated [[Class Template File]].
