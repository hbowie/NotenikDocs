##### Optional Linkage Between Class and Level Fields

In some collections it may be useful to have a tight correlation between [[Level]] values and[[Class]] values. When Notenik observes this sort of correlation, the [[New Note with Options]] screen will attempt to suggest the appropriate class for the given level after any user adjustments to the level.
