Title:  Supply EPUB Metadata

Seq:    4.11.5

Level:  4 - chunk

Class:  non-version

Index:  EPUB; 

Timestamp: 20250511215000

Body:

As an extension to the original Markdown spec from John Gruber, the content for the metadata section of an EPUB opf file may be provided following the literal `{:metadata}` on a line by itself, as in the following example:

```
{:metadata}
		<dc:identifier id="pub-identifier">notenik.app/kb</dc:identifier>
		<dc:title id="pub-title">The Notenik Knowledge Base</dc:title>
		<dc:creator id="author">Herb Bowie</dc:creator>
		<dc:language id="pub-language">en</dc:language>
		<meta property="dcterms:modified">2023-04-13T12:00:00Z</meta>
```

Note that the metadata elements shown above are considered mandatory in order to create a valid EPUB. 

The content following this command within the body of the current Note will be used as the publication metadata when using the [[Export as Web Book]] function to create an actual EPUB file. 

This command should appear as the first line within the body of a Note, and the remainder of the body will be used, in its entirety, and without further parsting, as the content appearing in the metadata element for a generated EPUB opf file.  

A Note containing this command may appear anywhere within a Collection, and be given any convenient and meaningful title. 

See the [[EPUB Metadata]] Note within the Notenik Knowledge Base for an example. 

Since a Note containing such a command is not meant to be read sequentially as part of the overall Collection, Notenik will generally skip such pages when formatting [[Streamlined Reading]] navigational elements.

##### Varying the modified date

Note that the `dcterms:modified` value is used as part of the key to form a unique identifier for an ebook. So if you have multiple copies of the same book, and this date-and-time value does not change, then e-book readers such as Apple Books will not be able to distinguish between them (and may in fact refuse to import something it considers a duplicate). 

In order to avoid such duplicates, the user may wish to replace a line like the one above -- containing a fixed value -- with something like the line below:

```
	<meta property="dcterms:modified">=$today&yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'$=</meta>
```

Notenik will then replace the `=$today&yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'$=` string with the properly formatted current date and time, as part of the EPUB export operation.
