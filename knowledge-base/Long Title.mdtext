Body:

The word `long-title` can be used as both a label and a type. 

A Collection is not expected to have more than one field of type `long-title`. 

A `long-title` field is meant to complement the standard [[Title]] field. 

A `long-title` field can be useful for collections for which the standard title will be sufficient for lists of notes, but for which longer titles are desired to appear at the top of each display, when using the [[Streamlined Reading]] display mode.
