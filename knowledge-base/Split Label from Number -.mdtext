Body:

A modifier of '`>`' can be used with a field value that contains both a numeric integer and a following alphabetic label, in order to obtain the label by itself, without the preceding number, and without any intervening spacing and/or punctuation. 

For example, a value of '`33 - Long Player`" would be modified to just '`Long Player`'.
