Teaser:

This release offers a new command to stash special Notenik files in their own folder, to avoid comingling them with your Note files; it also adds a new quotebiblio include style, for including quotations from a separate bibliography section; the Note pasting logic has been improved to improve field matching when field labels don't match exactly; the copyfile merge command has been improved to avoid inadvertently copying a whole folder of files; and the Website starter pack has had several improvements. 


Class:  version

Body:

##### Stashing Special Notenik Files

Added a new command to [[Stash Notenik's Special Files]], in order to hide these away in a subfolder. This may improve interoperability with some other Markdown wranglers.

##### Adding a New Quotebiblio Include Style

Added a new style value that can be used with the [[Include a Note or File]] Markdown command. A style of `quotebiblio` will produce a block quote with a following citation, and will attempt to pull author and work information from the quotation's parent Notes. 

##### Modified Note Pasting Logic

When pasting a Note from another Collection, Notenik will now attempt to do flexible field assignment, so that field labels need not exactly match in all cases. 

##### Improved Copyfile Logic

Modified the [[copyfile command]] so that, if a from file name is specified, but not available, then the command will be aborted (rather than copying the entire contents of the input folder).

##### Improved Website Starter Pack

Made several improvements to the [[Website]] starting Collection type.
