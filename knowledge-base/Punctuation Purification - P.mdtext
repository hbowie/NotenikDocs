Level:  4 - chunk

Class:  non-version

Timestamp: 20210616202228

Body:

The letter "P" will remove awkward punctuation characters, replacing them with spaces.

If the '`P`' is followed by an exclamation mark ('`!`'), then punctuation and spaces will be "squeezed" from the value, without any replacement.
