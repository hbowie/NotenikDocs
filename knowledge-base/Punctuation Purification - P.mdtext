Seq:    12.3.28

Level:  4 - Subsection

Index:  punctuation; 

Body:

The letter "P" will remove awkward punctuation characters, replacing them with spaces.

If the '`P`' is followed by an exclamation mark ('`!`'), then punctuation and spaces will be "squeezed" from the value, without any replacement.
