Body:

##### Changed Default Font for List Tab

The List tab now defaults to an Apple System font with monospaced digits (but proportionally spaced letters and other characters). 

##### Added Option to Change Font Settings for List Tab

The [[Display Settings]] have been modified to allow changing the font setting for the List Tab. 

##### Fixed Field Renaming Bug

When using the option to [[Rename a Field]], Notenik would sometimes erase the field from the Note being currently displayed, rather than renaming it. This has been corrected.

##### Fixed Query Refresh Bug

When requesting a refresh from the [[Query Output Window]], two new queries were being generated, instead of one, resulting in duplicate Query windows. This has been fixed.
