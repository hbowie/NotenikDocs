##### Added APIs for Hook Integration

Notenik has added some [[APIs for Hook Integration]], using AppleScript. Sample Hook scripts are provided, both to get the title and Custom Notenik URL for the currently selected Note, and to add a new Note. 

##### Expanded Custom URL Scheme

Added both `notepath` and `timestamp` as optional parameters to be used with the `open` command as part of the Notenik [[Custom URL Scheme]].
