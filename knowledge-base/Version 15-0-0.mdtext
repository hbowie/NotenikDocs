Small improvements in several spots; added a new quote-from command as a Markdown extension. 


Class:  version

Body:

##### Another Rule for Field Labels

When we we explain [[What We Mean by Label and Type]], a third rule has been added to aid with distinction between field labels, vs. field values that happen to contain a colon. The new rule is: a field label may not contain more than six spaces â€“ meaning no more than seven words separated by spaces.

##### Minutes to Read Fixed

When a [[Minutes to Read]] field is called out as a [[Merge Variable]], Notenik will now take steps to ensure the value is non-blank (assuming the presence of a body field value).

##### Added Quote-From Command

Added a new Markdown command to nicely [[Format a Quote Citation]].

##### Added New Share with Options Format

The [[Share with Options]] window now offers an option to format using `Markdown with quote-from`, which will make use of the new command to [[Format a Quote Citation]].

##### Note Selector Arrow Keys Selection Fixed

When using the the [[Note Selector]], and when using the arrow keys to move through a list of Notes, Notenik was previously allowing the selection to stray beyond the bounds of the visible Notes. This has been corrected.

##### Image Name Editing Fixed

When adding multiple image [[File Attachments]] to a Note, and when using an [[Image Name]] field, Notenik was not properly updating the list of available image files on the Edit tab. This has been corrected.

##### Improved Outline Starter Pack

Made a few improvements to the [[Outline]] starting collection type.
