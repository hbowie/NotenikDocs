Body:

##### Added Note ID Configuration Options

It's now possible to [[Change Note ID Configuration]] for a Collection so that each Note title no longer needs to be unique.

##### Added Strikethrough Support

Added support for the [[Strikethrough]] syntax. 

##### Added Subscript and Superscript Support

Added support for [[Subscript]] and [[Superscript]] notation. 

##### Fixed a Wikilink Bug Affecting Non-English Alphabets

When a Note's link ended up including non-English characters that required percent-encoding, Notenik was not decoding these properly. This has been corrected.

##### Fixed a Linking Bug Affecting Checklists

Notenik would sometimes screw up ordinary [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) when they occurred on a check box line. This has been corrected.
