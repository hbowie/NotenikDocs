Body:

##### Added Note ID Configuration Options

It's now possible to [[Change Note ID Configuration]] for a Collection so that each Note title no longer needs to be unique.

##### Fixed a Wikilink Bug Affecting Non-English Alphabets

When a Note's link ended up including non-English characters that required percent-encoding, Notenik was not decoding these properly. This has been corrected.
