Body:

Since a collection of notes lives on your local storage as a folder full of text files, it can be easily synced to the cloud and/or to other devices via a service such as [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) or [iCloud](http://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/). Simply store your collection somewhere in your Dropbox folder, or in your iCloud Drive folder.
