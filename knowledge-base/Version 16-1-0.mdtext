Class:  version

Body:

##### Added Open in Finder item

The [[project folder]] will now have an "Open in Finder" item generated, which will contain a link requesting the macOS Finder to open the Project Folder. 

##### Changed Title for a BBEdit project file.

When a [[project folder]] has a BBEdit project file at its top level, it will now show with a title of "Open in BBEdit". 

##### Added Ability to Paste CSV -> Table

A Markdown [[Table]] may now be generated from a comma-separated values file.

##### Added notefilename as new Merge Template Variable

Added a new [[System Variable]] of `notefilename` that can be used in a [[Merge Template]] to pull in the exact filename of the input Note.

##### Added a section-headings command

Added a `section-headings` Markdown command to [[Generate Sections for Headings]].

##### Provisioned an Optional add-ins folder

A folder named `add-ins` may now be placed within a collection folder. The add-ins folder can contain additional CSS and/or javascript files to be loaded. The CSS files must end with file extension `.css`, and the javascript files must end with the file extension `.js`.

##### Added a copyaddins Merge Template Command

Added a [[copyaddins command]] to copy files from the new [[add-ins folder]] to a comparable output folder.

##### Fixed Problem Allowing Duplicate Project Folders

Notenik had been mistakenly allowing a [[project folder]] to be opened in a new window, while leaving another window for the same folder still open. This has been corrected, so that the old window will be closed before opening the new one.
