Body:

A special variable name of `next-slug` can be used in a [[Merge Template]] in order to obtain a link that points from the current Note to the next note in the specified sort sequence. 

The resulting HTML will generate something that looks much like the link to each following Note created when you [[Export as Web Book]].
