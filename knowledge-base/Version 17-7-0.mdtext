##### Fixed Some Sequencing Issues

Found a bug in resequencing, and in displaying Seq values. I believe these have now been fixed.

##### Fixed a Biblio Quote Problem

When you [[Include a Note or File]] with a style of `quotebiblio`, there were some problems obtaining the author's name when the author had more than one work in the bibliography. This has been fixed. 

Also, when generating a biblio quote, if the author's name contains a comma, then Notenik will attempt to convert it so the first name appears first. 

##### Fixed a Title Formatting Problem

The [[Title]] value, as well as the [[Long Title]] value, are no longer being run through an XML converter before including in a display. This means that a long title can contain a `<br />` command in order to force a line break. 

##### Changed ToC Streamlined Reading Behavior

When in [[Streamlined Reading]] mode, or exporting as a web book, a Contents section will not be generated at the bottom of the page, showing children of the current Note, if the first such child would itself be a Table of Contents, as identified by a Title of "Table of Contents" or a class of `toc`. 

##### Fixed Some CSS Issues

The generated CSS was no longer respecting the user's font choices entered in the [[Display Settings]]. This has been corrected. 

##### Further UI Adjustments for Tahoe

Found some additional screens that Tahoe hadn't treated kindly, and adjusted these.

##### Added Optional Seq Formatting by Class

A [[Class Template File]] can now be used to specify a formatting string for a [[Seq]] field that is only to be applied to notes of a specific class. If supplied, this will override any formatting string that might have been specified for a certain level of a Seq value.
