Body:

##### Improved Linking

Relative links from a [[Link]] field were not being resolved correctly when they pointed to a [[project folder]]. This has been corrected.

##### Added New Notenik Custom URL Find Command

Added a new [[Notenik URL Find Command]] to tell Notenik to explicitly open a folder in the macOS Finder, rather than opening it as a collection within Notenik. 

##### Outlining for both Headings and Lists

If one places the Markdown command to [[Generate Outline Based on Unordered List Items]] immediately after the command to [[Generate Outline Based on Headings]], then one can generate disclosure triangles for both headings and unordered lists items.
