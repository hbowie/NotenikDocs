Title:  Decide Where to Store Everything

Seq:    6

Level:  2

Body:

When building a website, I typically don’t use the default location of the iCloud Notenik folder, because I end up with many different folders that I need to access in a variety of ways. The Sites folder within your home folder (as a peer to your Documents folder) is the traditional location for website stuff. If it doesn’t already exist, then create it. 

You will then want to have a folder for your website within the Sites folder, named however you would like. 

And then you will want a `content` folder within that.
