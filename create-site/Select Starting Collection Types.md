Title:  Select Starting Collection Type(s)

Body:

Now it's time to build the Notenik Collection(s) that will house your content. Note that there are two possible approaches here.

1. Create a separate Collection for each content type. With this approach, each different content type will have its own folder within the `content` folder referenced earlier. 

2. Use the [class](https://notenik.app/kb/class.html) field to distinguish between different content types stored in the same Collection. With this approach, your single content Collection can simply occupy the entire `content` folder. 

When you create a new Collection, Notenik offers you a number of [Starting Collection Types](https://notenik.app/kb/starting-collection-types.html) from which you can choose. 

If you find one that seems close to your intentions, then starting with one of these models can save you time. 

On the other hand, once you become more proficient with Notenik, you may decide you just want to start with [Basic Notes](https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html) and then tailor as needed. 

### Example

For our website building example, we will start with the [Website](https://notenik.app/kb/website.html) model. 

Note that this supports the two content types we've been discussing — *page* and *post* — and it uses the class field to distinguish between these two content types within a single collection. 

Note also that this starting Collection Type will actually install a number of other folders in addition to the collection folder itself.
