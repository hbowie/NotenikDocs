3. Skills

	You need not be an expert at any of this, but you should at least have some basic understanding of:

4. Web Stuff

	+ Domain name - to provide an address for your website

5. Reference

	+ In addition to the links provided above, this guide will make frequent reference to the [Notenik Knowledge Base](https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html).
