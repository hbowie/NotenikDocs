#### Notenik's Default CSS

Notenik uses a combination of HTML and CSS to format each note for viewing on its *Display* tab. 

Notenik provides its own default CSS, in case you don't wish to be bothered with providing any. It's not particularly fancy, though.

This is the styling you've been seeing so far within Notenik.
