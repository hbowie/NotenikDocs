Title:  Tweaking Notenik's default CSS

Seq:    4.3

Level:  3 - section

Body:

Notenik also allows you to tweak the default CSS that it uses. 

First, make sure that you don't have any of the special CSS files selected for your collection. 

Next, open the *Display Appearance* item beneath the *Notenik* menu. 

Here you'll find a number of options. 

You can center heading for any sequence of levels. 

You can modify the fonts used for body text and/or for headings and/or for the *List* tab. 

You can choose from a short list of common fonts, or elect to choose from the full list of fonts installed on your system. 

And you can also modify font sizes. 

All of this can be done without learning any CSS syntax. You can see the CSS being generated for you, though, and you can see what effect your updates will have. 

Once your done making your adjustments, just hit *OK* to put them into effect. 

Note that changes made here will affect the display of *all* of your collections â€” not just the one currently open.
