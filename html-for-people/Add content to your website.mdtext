Title:  Add content to your website

Seq:    2

Level:  2

Body:

Start by reading the corresponding [HTML for people chapter](https://www.htmlforpeople.com/add-content-to-your-website/).

#### Step 1. Add a Heading

With Notenik you can code HTML tags if you want to, but you may also use the [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a sort of shorthand for coding many HTML tags. 

So here's how we would add a heading using Notenik, replacing the body field with the following:

```
# Herb's Homepage

My name is Herb. I enjoy making websites, and making software to make it easier to make websites. 
```

Notice that all we had to do to create a heading was to add a hash character at the beginning of the heading text, and then leave a blank line between the heading and the following paragraph. No need for paragraph tags at all, and no need for a closing '`</h1>`' tag. 

And then, when you click on the *Display* tab, Notenik will show you how your web page is looking so far â€” no need to load anything in your web browsser just yet. 

#### Step 2. Linking to other websites 

Again, we can use the Markdown syntax to add links to our text. 

Just add the following to your *body* text. 

```
Check out these cool app reviews from [Lou Plummer's AppAddict page](https://apps.louplummer.lol/). 
```

Do you see what we've done? We've added a new paragraph (just by virtue of inserting a blank line before the addtional text), and the text to serve as the visible link is placed within square brackets, and then followed immediately by the *href* value within parentheses. 

Now hit the *Display* tab again and you can preview your work, again right within Notenik. 

#### Step 3. Lists of things

As you might have guessed, Markdown also has a shorthand syntax for lists. 

Here's an example of an *unordered list* you can add to your home page. 

```
## Favorite Movies

+ It's A Wonderful Life
+ The Long Goodbye
+ The Thin Man
```

Notice we used two leading hash marks to indicate a level 2 heading, and started each list item with a plus sign. 

And to make an ordered list?

Just number your items as in the following example. 

```
## How to make a website

1. Create some content
2. Create a merge template
3. Create a script
4. Run the script
5. Open the output with your web browser

Note that, even if the numbers are not in sequence (because of an insertion, for example), the resulting numbered list will still be numbered consecutively, starting at 1. 

```

#### Step 4. Add images to your website
