How will you present your content to site visitors? A blog typically shows the latest post, followed by earlier ones, plus some sort of archive access. Depending on your content type(s), different means of filtering and ordering your content may be appropriate. Try to visualize what will make the most sense for your site. 

Note that, as you think of different organizational/navigational schemes for your project, this thinking may help you refine and possibly expand your list of content types.
