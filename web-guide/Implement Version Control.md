Title:  Implement Version Control

Seq:    10

Level:  2

Class:  chapter

Body:

This is an optional step, but using some sort of version control will allow you to track the history of your work, and allow you to revert to an earlier configuration if something goes terribly wrong at some point. 

I would typically use Git, and use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) as my Git client. But once you start creating files within your site's folder, it's a good idea to use some sort of version control, and start checking stuff in regularly.
