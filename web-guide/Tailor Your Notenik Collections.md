Seq:    8

Level:  2

Class:  chapter

Body:

There are several different ways to tailor each of your Collection(s). 

1. Modify the various settings available as part of your [Collection Settings](https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-collection-settings.html). 

2. Add or remove fields through the Collection Settings screen. 

3. [Rename, Add or Remove a Field](https://notenik.app/kb/rename-a-field.html) using the special Collection option designed for that purpose. 

4. Edit the [Collection Template File](https://notenik.app/kb/the-collection-template-file.html) to add fields and modify the configuration settings (for field types that have these). 

It's best to generally start at the top of this list, proceeding farther down it only when needed. 

### Example

Review the Collection Settings for your new Collection, and make any changes you would like.
