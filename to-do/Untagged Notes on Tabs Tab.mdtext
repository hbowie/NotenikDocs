Body:

If there are a lot of untagged notes, then it can make it difficult to actually see the tags. 

On the other hand, it can be handy to see notes that might have missed being tagged. 

Possible improvements:

+ Move them to the end?

+ Or give them a pseudo-tag of *untagged* which would appear at the top of the list, so they could be hidden?
