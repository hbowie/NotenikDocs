Body:

Here Iâ€™ll point out a specific issue regarding YAML metadata parsing in Notenik. I have a folder in Notenik where I autmatically add my Kindle annotations. For this purpose I use kindle plugin for Obsidian. This plugin has a customizable template for a great control over added YAML metadata. My current issue is the plugin autmatically insert some other metadata for proper syncing between the Kindle and the designated folder.
